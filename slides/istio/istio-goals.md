## Goals

* **Traffic management** : control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more 
robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* **Observability** : gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing 
the ability to quickly identify issues.
* **Policy Enforcement** : apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and 
resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* **Service identity and security** : provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service 
traffic.
